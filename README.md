# Harmony Project - a Discord clone student project

This project represents a more refined version of my previous student project for Epitech school called MyIRC.

It utilized the following modules:

- **cors: ^2.8.5**
  - *Explanation:* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin to access resources from a different origin.

- **express: ^4.18.2**
  - *Explanation:* Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.

- **nodemon: ^2.0.20**
  - *Explanation:* Nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts the server. It is particularly useful during the development phase.

- **socket.io: ^4.5.3**
  - *Explanation:* Socket.io enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication. It is commonly used for building interactive and dynamic web applications that require instant updates.
    
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This project would never have come to fruition without the assistance of the YouTuber: [CodeWithAntonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio) ü§óüíñ .

## Nevertheless !
I've added my personal touch to enhance the code and make it standalone. This includes implementing a custom system for user authentication/registration and file hosting. Additionally, I'll be revamping the user interface.
